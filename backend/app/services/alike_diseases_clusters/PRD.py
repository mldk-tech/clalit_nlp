Disease Clustering System for Medical Appointment Summaries
================================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
==================
Project Name: Disease Clustering and Similarity Analysis System
Version: 1.0
Date: 2024
Objective: Analyze doctor appointment summaries to identify and cluster similar diseases based on clinical patterns, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
===================
The medical appointment summaries dataset contains diverse clinical information that needs systematic organization to:
- Identify diseases with similar clinical presentations
- Group conditions requiring similar diagnostic approaches
- Categorize treatments by effectiveness patterns
- Understand patient outcome correlations across disease groups

3. DATA SOURCE
==============
- File: doctor_appointment_summaries.json
- Records: 2,402 appointment summaries
- Doctors: 10 (dr_01 through dr_10)
- Fields: id, doctor_id, summary, future_outcome

4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
==========================

4.1 Data Processing
-------------------
- Extract disease names and conditions from appointment summaries
- Identify symptoms, treatments, and diagnostic procedures
- Parse patient outcomes and severity levels
- Normalize medical terminology

4.2 Clustering Criteria
-----------------------
Primary clustering dimensions:
a) Symptom-based clustering
   - Pain-related conditions (headache, back pain, abdominal pain)
   - Respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough)
   - Systemic symptoms (fatigue, dizziness)
   - Skin conditions (rash, eczema)

b) Treatment-based clustering
   - Medication types (antibiotics, pain relievers, inhalers)
   - Specialist referrals (cardiology, neurology, orthopedics)
   - Diagnostic procedures (imaging, blood tests)

c) Outcome-based clustering
   - Recovery patterns
   - Chronic vs acute conditions
   - Severity progression

d) Anatomical clustering
   - Cardiovascular system
   - Respiratory system
   - Gastrointestinal system
   - Neurological system
   - Musculoskeletal system
   - Dermatological system

4.3 Clustering Algorithm Requirements
------------------------------------
- Support multiple clustering approaches (hierarchical, k-means, DBSCAN)
- Handle text-based medical data
